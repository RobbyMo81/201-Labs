  <p id="p1">
    My name is Jesse <b>Pena</b>. I'm an <b>Army</b> veteran and an <b>Evergreen State College</b> graduate. I was a medic in the Army and I studied ecology at Evergreen. I worked briefly as a <b>utility forester</b> where I patrolled for hazardous vegetation and made recommendations for trims or removals.

    My goal here at CodeFellows is to learn the skills necessary to become a qualified candidate for a job as a software developer. I also want to build networking skills to land a job that I will love and will pay well. I want to build a <b>better life</b> for me and my family.
