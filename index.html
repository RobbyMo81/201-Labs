  <p>
    My name is Jesse <b>Pena</b>. I'm an <b>Army</b> veteran and an <b>Evergreen State College</b> grad. I worked briefly as a <b>utility forester</b> where I patrolled for hazardous vegetation and made recommendations for trims or removals.

  <p>
    My goal here at CodeFellows is to learn the skills necessary to become a qualified candidate for a job as a software developer. I want to build a <b>better life</b>.
